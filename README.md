# Beacon

A modern status page service for monitoring and incident communication.

## About

Beacon helps teams communicate service health to their users through:

- **Public Status Pages** - Real-time service health at a glance
- **Incident Management** - Declare, update, and resolve incidents with full timeline
- **Subscriber Notifications** - Proactive alerts via Slack, email, and webhooks
- **Uptime Tracking** - Historical availability metrics

## Demo Project

This repository serves as the demo project for [Decibel Tools](https://github.com/decibel-systems/decibel-tools-mcp), showcasing AI-native project intelligence in action.

The `.decibel/` folder contains structured project context that AI assistants can query to provide informed, contextualized responses.

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mediareason/beacon.git

# Register with Decibel Tools
# In Claude Desktop or Claude Code, ask:

```
