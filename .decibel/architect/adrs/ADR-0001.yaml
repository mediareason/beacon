status: accepted
created_at: 2025-01-02T09:00:00Z
context: |
  We need a database for storing services, incidents, and subscriber data.
  Options considered: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite.
decision: |
  Use PostgreSQL as the primary database.
  - Strong ACID compliance for incident data integrity
  - Excellent JSON support for flexible metadata
  - Proven scalability for our projected load
  - Team familiarity reduces onboarding time
consequences: |
  Positive:
  - Reliable transaction support for incident updates
  - Can use JSONB for component metadata without schema migrations
  - Easy local development with Docker
  
  Negative:
  - Slightly more operational complexity than SQLite
  - Need to manage connection pooling at scale
